# Python-Projs
This repository contains multiple projects. 
I will be uploading solutions of every chapter of the book Python Crash Course - A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming. 
Secondly, projects at the end of the book will also be uploaded. 
This repository would also contain the final project of a Data Science & AI course offered on Coursera by IBM.
It would serve the beginners as well as advanced programmers of Python.
